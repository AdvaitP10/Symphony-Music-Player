# Symphony

Symphony is a song player app made by using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
It is made using React.js library.
The React Component library used in here is Material UI (https://mui.com/)
I have also used JSON-server to host my database(song-player/data/db.json).

### NOTE:

In case you get a blank white screen without card components then kindly host db.json on local host port 8000 using
json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
